# Unhandled Client-Side Error in Next.js Functional Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: unhandled client-side errors within functional components.  The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable that hasn't been defined, causing a runtime error in the browser.

## Problem

The `About` component in `about.js` tries to use a variable (`nonExistentVariable`) that is not declared or defined.  This leads to a runtime error, breaking the page for the user.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution by implementing proper error handling.  We check if the variable exists before attempting to use it.  A more robust approach might involve using a default value or loading data asynchronously with error handling.
